Started project. As we mentioned in our proposal, since we are just a group of two,
we aren't sure how much of the entire BitTorrent protocol we will be able to fully
implement. Thus, we started working on a prototype that would have the most basic 
structure of the general BitTorrent architecture. 

Wrote the b-encoding helper functions and reused some chunks of code from previous 
assignments to get the communication over-the-wire working. We added functionality 
for peers and the tracker to send each other messages in a couple major ways. The
current methodology simply uses files stored in folders to represent each peer's 
current pieces of the overall file, and downloading from one another is represented
by peers writing files from bytes passed along by other peers into new files in
their respective folders. There are some bugs to work out, but we have solid progress
in creating a working prototype.

Finished making the protoype. Files properly are shared between peers.
